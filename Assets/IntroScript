Intro:

Oh... what a beautiful night... 

Moon is out, no kids playing after sunset...

A bottle of my favourite grape juice in one hand
and my favourite pretzel snack in the other...

<Fiance's name> won't realize I'm gone.

Nothing beats this.

!! Gh.. Gh!

Ghck! 
(It's stuck.. Pretzel's stuck! My throat...!)
