Intro:

Ah... what a beautiful night... 

The moon is out, no kids playing after sunset...

A bottle of my favourite grape juice in one hand
and my favourite pretzel snack in the other...

It's like all my worries are far away.

Munch much... chew chew... Gulp!

Whew, that hits the spot.

...Hm. I guess it's about time I head back home to <Fiance's name>. 
It has been a while. Don't want her to worry.

Munch munch...

Chew chew...

Gul...

...

Gul...?
(What the...)

...

...!

!!! 

Gh... Gh!! *chokes*

Ghck! 
(It's stuck.. Pretzel's stuck! My throat... Can't... Breathe...!)

*trips*

(Whoah!)

*falls*

(Aaaaah!)



[Scene transition to under the bridge, daytime]



Holy bananas! What a fall. Did I pass out? It's so bright out. 

More importantly...

How the heck am I still alive?! That was like the biggest drop 
into a freezing river! I never understood physics...

Now I really should get back home ASAP, before <Fiance's name>
freaks out and does something drastic.
